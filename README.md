# BootCon-Presentation
Final cybersecurity presentation delivered at SMU’s bootCon Conference, showcasing hands-on projects, tools, and real-world defensive strategies.
# bootCon Presentation: Cybersecurity Project Showcase

## Overview
This project represents my final capstone presentation for the **SMU Cybersecurity Bootcamp’s bootCon Conference**, where I presented a full-scale security project to peers, instructors, and industry professionals. The presentation summarized my hands-on technical work, research process, and the real-world security implications of my project.

The bootCon presentation demonstrates my ability to communicate complex cybersecurity topics, translate technical findings into actionable insights, and deliver professional documentation suitable for an executive or SOC-level audience.

## Objectives
- Research, design, and present a cybersecurity topic of choice.
- Demonstrate practical implementation of key concepts such as network defense, system hardening, threat detection, or vulnerability management.
- Apply networking, cryptographic, and security principles learned throughout the bootcamp.
- Present research findings and technical demonstrations using a professional slide deck.

## Project Summary
My project focused on **[insert your specific project title, e.g., “Hardening a Linux Server for Secure Operations” or “Building a Security Monitoring Environment”]**.

During the presentation, I covered:
1. **Technical Background** – Why I selected the project and what cybersecurity problem it addressed.  
2. **Tools & Techniques** – Demonstration of relevant tools such as Splunk, Snort, Nessus, and Linux configuration commands.  
3. **Implementation Process** – Step-by-step overview of how the solution was built and tested.  
4. **Results & Findings** – Screenshots, metrics, and data visualizations summarizing the outcome.  
5. **Conclusion & Lessons Learned** – Key takeaways about system defense, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
